# Mission-to-Mars
## Failed First Attempt
In this module I attempted to automate a web browser to visit different websites and extract data about Mars. The goal was to use MongoDB to store data in a NoSQL database, and then render the data in a web application created with Flask. I failed to do so. From the very beginning of this assignment, it was riddled with complications. I did my best to not let this failure derail my goal to complete the bootcamp and learn as much as possible.  

Initially my web browser was my issue, and possibly still is the route of my demise. I began the project using Firefox as my web browser. I tried to adapt the firefox dependencies into my scrapping.py for far to long with no success. That lead me into other areas that may or may not have been my issue. 

I struggled with environment issues for the first time when I could not us MongoDb with the file structure I had developed early in the course. I initially learned and navigated the Anaconda prompt decently. The web browser issue lead me to try to correct and clean my environment in hopes of a resolution. Once my files were inline with Mongo I was able to get some basic functionality out of my index.html site. But soon after got lost within my own file structure and the new course content. 

I asked for help on different levels and received it each time. With help I learned more about anaconda environments, file structure, and pandas libraryâ€™s. I am submitting the code as I have it. Then Im going to create a new repo and start from scratch. Scrapping is an important element for the analyst so I want to figure out the procedure.
